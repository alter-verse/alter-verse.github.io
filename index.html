    <h1>Hello, I’m Suryagayathri</h1>
    <p class="intro">Aspiring QA Specialist | Data Curious | Detail-Oriented Problem Solver</p>

    <p>I’m a tech-minded problem solver with a strong interest in quality assurance, software testing, and data analytics. Currently pursuing my education in software support and development, I enjoy identifying patterns, analyzing systems, and making things work better.</p>

    <p>I’m especially drawn to roles that blend logic and structure with purpose — whether that’s ensuring clean, functional code through QA testing or drawing insights from messy datasets. I believe technology should work beautifully *and* reliably.</p>

    <p>Outside of school and work, I’m constantly learning — from taking online courses to building personal projects that strengthen my skills in testing, analysis, and reporting.</p>

    <p>I’m open to opportunities that allow me to grow in tech through hands-on learning, mentorship, and collaboration. My goal? To build a career I’m proud of — one that’s thoughtful, stable, and impactful.</p>

    <p>Let’s connect!</p>
